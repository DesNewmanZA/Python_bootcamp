I am a motivated, passionate person who loves the challenge of solving problems and learning new skills.
Every task I undertake is executed with dedication, care and attention to detail.

I have been working as a quantitative analyst in credit risk modelling for nearly a decade, focusing on Basel capital
and IFRS 9 impairment models. During this time, I have gained specialist modelling skills within a retail and retail
SME context, across a diverse range of banking portfolios and products.

In my spare time, I enjoy honing my programming skills as well as being outdoors and exploring the beautiful
South African countryside.
